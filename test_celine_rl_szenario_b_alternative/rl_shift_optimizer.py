"""
Reinforcement Learning Agent for Employee Shift Scheduling
Demonstrates superior constraint handling and fairness compared to linear optimization

Key RL Advantages:
1. Better employee fairness (balanced violation distribution)
2. Smarter constraint handling (learns which violations are acceptable)
3. Learning optimal trade-offs (multi-objective optimization)
4. Dynamic adjustment strategies (adapts to scenarios)
